As usual in regression, the intercept is the value of the dependent variable when all numerical predictors are equal to 0 and nominal variables are at their reference level. In  this case, the intercept represents the value of the DV for condition Non-Variable Indicative (NVI). We observe that for condition NVS, the pupillary dilation is -7.13 ties smaller than for NVI, which supports our hypothesis.\n\n#### Random smooths\n\n**1. edf**\n\nThe edf value is indicative of the amount of non-linearity of the smooth. If the edf value for a certain smooth is (close to) 1, this means that the pattern is (close to) linear, while a value greater than 1 indicates that the pattern is more complex (i.e. non-linear).\n\n**2. Ref.df and F**\n\nThe Ref.df value is the reference number of degrees of freedom used for hypothesis testing (on the basis of the associated F-value)\n\n**3. p-value**\n\nThe p-value associated with each smooth indicates if the smooth is significantly different from 0. In this case, all variables are highly significantly different fro 0. If we focus on the first two lines of coefficients, which are those of interest to us, we see that the p-value for NVI is much higher than for NVS, indicating a higher difference from 0.\n\n#### Goodness-of-fit measures\n\nThe adjusted r2 represents the amount of variance explained by the regression and the deviance explained is a generalization of r2 and will be very similar to the actual r2. Bpth ofn them re pretty good in this model. Consider that with time series data, especially when we try to account for as much variability as possible, is is *very common* to see deviance explained values that are quite low. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, it is just a b-product of the type of data and models were are using.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## In Part III, we will learn to visualize GAMMs results.\n\n## To be continued!","metadata":{}}]}
